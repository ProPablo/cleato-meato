## Discovery and build notes
- Used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_cdAYDHR0E to setup for c# debugging
- Be sure to refresh .godot for the chance there is movement bug, watch out for values in the inspector being spoookily set to null. 
- Reset and delete build config for icon to actually be set
